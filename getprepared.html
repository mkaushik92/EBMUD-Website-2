			<h1>How do you store water?</h1>
			<p>
				It is critical for you to have water on hand because it can take over a
				week for your water supply to be restored after a disaster or emergency.
				Businesses may be closed, and the retail price of water may
				increase. Storing water is as simple as determining how much you need
				and the best way to store it in your home.

		<div id= "How Much Water">
			<h2><span>How much water do you need?</span></h2>
			<p>
				Individual needs vary, depending on age, health, physical condition,
				activity, diet and climate, however the basic guideline is to store 2
				gallons per person per day for 7 days. In other words, each person should
				store 14 gallons of water for a 1-week emergency supply.

		<div id="Storage Methods">
			<h2><span>What are different storage methods?</span></h2>
			<p>
				Based on your water needs and space available in your home, you may
				choose to store water in one of the ways shown below. You should follow
				container manufacturer instructions for storage and maintenance of your
				emergency water supply, but in general you should store the water in a
				cool, dark place or a temperature-controlled environment. You should
				also replace emergency water that was not purchased from a store every
				six months. If using store-bought water bottles, ensure you purchase
				BPA-free plastic.

			<h2><span>How do you sterilize water?</span></h2>
			<p>
				If you have used all of your stored water and there are no other
				reliable clean water sources, it may become necessary to treat
				water so that it is safe to use.
				<br /> <br />
				Treat all water of uncertain quality before using it for drinking,
				food washing or preparation, washing dishes, brushing teeth or making
				ice. In addition to having a bad odor and taste, contaminated water can
				contain microorganisms (germs) that cause diseases such as dysentery,
				cholera, typhoid and hepatitis.
			</p>
			<br />

  			<div class="column">
					<h3>
						<img style='vertical-align:bottom;' src="svg/boiling-icon.svg" width=30px>
						Boiling Water
					</h3>
					<p>
						Boiling is the safest method of treating water. In a large pot or
						kettle, bring water to a rolling boil for one full minute, keeping
						in mind that some water will evaporate. Let the water cool before
						drinking.
						<br /><br />

						Boiled water will taste better if you put oxygen back into it by
						pouring the water back and forth between two clean containers. This
						also will improve the taste of stored water.
					</p>
  			</div>
			  <div class="column">
			  	<h3>
						<img style='vertical-align:bottom;' src="svg/chlorination-icon.svg" width=30px>
						Chlorination
					</h3>
					<p>
						You can use household liquid bleach to kill microorganisms. Use
						only regular household liquid bleach that contains 5.25 to 6.0
						percent sodium hypochlorite. Do not use scented bleaches, color
						safe bleaches or bleaches with added cleaners.
						<br /><br />

						Add 16 drops (1/8 teaspoon) of bleach per gallon of water, stir and
						let stand for 30 minutes. The water should have a slight bleach
						odor. If it doesn’t, then repeat the dosage and let stand another
						15 minutes. If it still does not smell of chlorine, discard it and
						find another source of water.
						<br /><br />

						Other chemicals, such as iodine or water treatment products sold in
						camping or surplus stores that do not contain 5.25 or 6.0 percent
						sodium hypochlorite as the only active ingredient, are not
						recommended and should not be used.
					</p>
			  </div>
  			<div class="column">
					<h3>
						<img style='vertical-align:bottom' src="svg/distillation-icon.svg" width=30px>
						Distillation
					</h3>
					<p>
						While boiling and chlorination will kill most microbes in water,
						distillation will remove microbes (germs) that resist these methods,
						as well as heavy metals, salts and most other chemicals.
						Distillation involves boiling water and then collection of only the
						vapor that condenses. The condensed vapor will not include salt or
						most other impurities.
						<br /><br />
						To distill, fill a pot halfway with water. Tie a cup to the handle
						on the pot’s lid so that the cup will hang right-side-up when the
						lid is upside-down (make sure the cup is not dangling into the
						water) and boil the water for 20 minutes. The water that drips from
						the lid into the cup is distilled.
