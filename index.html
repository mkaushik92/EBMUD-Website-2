			<h1>Why do you need to store water?</h1>
			<p>
				Following a disaster, such as an earthquake or wildfire, your utility may
				be unable to deliver water through your tap. Alternatively, tap water may be contaminated.
				It could take a week to restore systems to normal, which means you should keep a back-up supply
				of water at home.

						The <strong>Hayward fault line</strong>, shown in the image to the left, extends from San Jose
						about 74 miles northward along the base of the East Bay Hills to
						San Pablo Bay. Communities on or near the fault include San Jose,
						Oakland, Fremont, Richmond, Berkeley, Hayward, San Leandro, San Lorenzo,
						El Cerrito, Emeryville, Kensington and Milpitas. Given that the last major earthquake
						was more than 150 years ago in 1868, scientists are convinced that
						the Hayward Fault has reached the point where a powerful,
						damaging earthquake can be expected at any time. USGS earthquake
						science tells us that it’s now urgent to prepare for the next magnitude
						7 quake on the Hayward Fault.<br />

			<h3>Why does an earthquake impact water supply?</h3>
			<p>
				The <a href="https://www.ebmud.com/">East Bay Municipal Utilities District</a>
				(EBMUD) provides high-quality drinking water for 1.4 million customers in the
				Alameda and Contra Costa counties. EBMUD has 4,100 miles of pipeline and 5 treatment plants.
				Although EBMUD completed an extensive Seismic Improvement program (SIP), there are
				still many vulnerabilities to earthquakes in the system. They
				have predicted almost 4,000 pipe breaks in the event of a 6.7 magnitude earthquake.
			</p>
			<p>
				EBMUD’s system is particularly vulnerable (compared to other Bay Area
				water utilities) because:
				<ul>
					<li>
					Interdependencies with other systems. EBMUD's pumps rely on
					electricity provided by PG&E which can be impacted by earthquakes.</li>
					<li>Soil types and geography: many of EBMUD's service areas are susceptible to landslides,
						liquefaction areas, etc. </li>
					<li>Their pipes cross a major fault</li>
					<li>They have a large number of pumping stations, many on the fault
						(whereas some other utilities operate on flatter terrain).
						40% of service relies on pumps. </li>
					<li>
						Pipes themselves are fragile due to factors such as age, material, etc.

				</ul>

			<h2><span>A Day with Water</span></h2>
			<p>
				We engage in several activities each day that need water, from bathing
				to cooking. In the event of an emergency, businesses and schools may
				be closed, requiring you to stay at home. The map below walks through a typical day
				with water for one person to show how many common activities require water.

	<div id= "Usage Breakdown">
			<h2><span>Water Usage Breakdown</span></h2>
			<p class="bold-text">
				According to the U.S. Geological Survey, the average person uses 80 gallons
				or more of water per day for indoor activities such as cooking, flushing the toilet,
				taking a shower or bath, washing hands, etc.
			</p>
			<p>
				This estimate varies based on number of people in
				household, type of faucets and plumbing systems, and other factors. <br />
				Please note that the water usage breakdown shown below is missing some
				common activities such as cleaning, laundry, watering plants, etc.

			This map shows what a day without water might look like if you do not
			store water beforehand. Without stored water, you will likely need to make adjustments
			to your daily activities, be unable to complete certain activities (e.g., shower or rinse),
			and/or may spend more money on emergency water due to potential price inflation.
